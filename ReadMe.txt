This code is based on the work in  [1]

We have give an example of anminal sequence (run demo)

The tracking result is saved in result file

For other sequences, the reader can put video sequences in the code file and mainly adjust two paremeter: afnv and threshold in the demo for obtaining good tracking performance.
